# paperboy
a WIP minimalistic rss reader / read it later tool

## setup
* add the update.php file to cron
* symlink index.php to `/var/www/html/` or wherever your webserver hosts stuff from
make sure that the webserver user can read index.php and paperboy.db (paperboy.db gets created by update.php)
